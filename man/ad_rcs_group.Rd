\title{A function to apply an RCS model to log data.}
\usage{
ad_rcs_group(diff_days, count_visitor, knots = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{diff_days}{A vector containing the list of day since the start of the recording.}

\item{count_visitor}{A vector of number of visitor per day.}

\item{knots}{The number of knots fitted to the knots. By default 3. A larger value may better fit log data with a long/complicated history, at the expense of being to overfitted to anomalous episode.}
}
\value{
The results of the SVM model.
}
